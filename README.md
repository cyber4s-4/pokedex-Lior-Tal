# pokedex-Lior-Tal

# Hello Ofer/Dima/Idan!
PokeDex V3 is complete and is placed in 'pagination-server' branch, we're still working on V3 bonuses (favorite button + heroku) </br>
Therfore we ask you to checkout to branch 'pagination-server' instead of 'main'.</br> 
As soon as we finish the bonuses we'll merge the branches and init on heroku.

# The differences:

## 'pagination-server' branch
* Includes PokeDex V3 (most recent)
* Is built for local execution (gulp)
* Pagination is included
* Communicates with mongoDB server that holds over 250,000 Pokemons

## 'main' branch

* Includes PokeDex V2 (last week's version)
* Is built for heroku
* Is not updated to V3 (yet)
